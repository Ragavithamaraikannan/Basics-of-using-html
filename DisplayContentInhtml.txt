   <h1> A Template for killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>Over the years of developing websites for cilents,I've learned that the age-old adage,<strong>"If you want it done right,you gotta do it yourself,"</strong> can be a two-way street.</p>

  <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank" >
    <img src="images/mini.jpg"
     width="110px" 
     title="photo" 
     alt="title"/>
    </a>
    
   <p> Of course,there are companies out there that have great web writers internally,but most don't.And the thought of a company turning a great website content strategy <u>(that we slaved over)</u> an effective <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">"brochure site"</a>gives me heartburn.But sometimes you have to pick your battles.<p/>
    
    <p>in cases where we give in and let the cilent take the content reins,we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a template that gives them a flighting chance to produce effective website content that drives action. Here is a template we like to use,and an explanantion of what's included.</p>

    <h2>Website Content Template Components</h2>

    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the web pages. With the help of HTML, you can create a complete website structure. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.<br/>
        <br/><i> Hypertext defines the link between the web pages </i> markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages</p>
